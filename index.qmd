### Welcome
**Welcome** to Gavin Fayâ€™s lab at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth.

[Read about our lab culture & philosophy.](https://thefaylab.github.io/lab-manual/02-lab-culture-philosophy.html)

Our research focuses on developing and testing quantitative modeling tools used for assessment and management of living marine resources, working to advance sustainable decision-making for our oceans and the people who depend on them in a changing world. We focus on decision support tools applied to management of fish, marine mammal, and reptile populations, regionally in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic of the USA, as well as elsewhere nationally and internationally. A central theme is considering the performance of methods used for management given an ecosystem and socio-ecological systems perspective, and assessing the robustness of policy alternatives to a range of system uncertainties, including the impacts of climate change.

We embrace [open data science approaches](https://openscapes.org/) to help make our work more shareable, accessible, and reproducible. Common to all our work is an applied approach to improve the advice for science-based decision-making by living resource management agencies, and we collaborate and partner with these institutions and engage in their public decision-making processes.

[Lab Code of Conduct](https://thefaylab.github.io/lab-manual/03-code-of-conduct.html)

[Prospective graduate students](jointhelab.html#futuregrads) may contact Gavin about his availability as a faculty advisor.

Current UMassD undergraduate students interested in working in the group should check [the opportunities section](jointhelab.html#undergrads) for advertised marine data science research technician positions.
