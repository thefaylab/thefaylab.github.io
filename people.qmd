[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9Ea9PWwAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra)*

Amanda grew up in New Mexico and attended the University of Miami where she majored in Marine Science and Biology. She is currently a stock assessment Fish Biologist at NOAA Fisheries Northeast Fisheries Science Center in Woods Hole. Her PhD thesis work is centered around developing methods and communication tools for ecosystem-based fisheries Management Strategy Evaluation.
