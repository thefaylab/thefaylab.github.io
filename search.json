    "text": "Bookdown to Quarto\nConverting a Bookdown book to Quarto is slightly more involved than converting a website. A book has chapters whose order must be defined, and likely has citations and cross-refs. Still, conversion is not that hard.\nWe got some practice converting from Bookdown to Quarto by helping Gavin Fay convert his lab’s fantastic onboarding documentation, the Faylab Lab Manual. Here’s the GitHub view before and after.\nOur best first reference material for this was Nick Tierney’s Notes on Changing from Rmarkdown/Bookdown to Quarto. Nick shares some scripts in that post to automate some changes. In our case, the book was small enough that we made all changes manually. Quarto documentation was indispensable.\n\nExperimenting in a low-risk environment\nWe forked a copy of the Faylab Lab manual to the Openscapes organization, and worked in a branch so we could make changes relatively risk-free. We could always fork a new copy of the original if we “broke” something. (Caution: the default when making a pull request from a fork is to push changes to the original upstream repo, not your fork and it does this without warning if you have write-access to that repo.) With local previews it’s easy to test / play with settings to see what they do. We tended to make a change, Preview, then compare the look and functionality of the book to the original. It was helpful to comment out some elements of the configuration file _output.yml after their counterparts had been added to the Quarto configuration file _quarto.yml, or to confirm they were no longer needed, before making the drastic move of deleting them.\n\n\nThe conversion\nHere are the main steps to convert the Faylab Lab manual from Bookdown to Quarto.\nCreate new empty file called _quarto.yml and add book metadata there. The screenshots below\nSet project type as book.\nMove metadata out of index.qmd and into _quarto.yml. Title, author, and publication date were in index.qmd with date set using date: \"Last updated:r Sys.Date()\". Now these are in _quarto.yml with date set using date: last-modified. Note that having R code would require you to adjust code chunk options in the Quarto style (#|). This tripped us up a bit; see GitHub Actions.\nMove chapters listing out of _bookdown.yml and into _quarto.yml.\nAdd page footer to _quarto.yml.\nHere’s what ours looked like when we finished the steps above (_quarto.yml).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_quarto.yml contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFaylab Lab Manual\n\n\n\n\n\nChange insertion of images from html style to Quarto style. (Note Quarto calls them “figures”, not “images”.) The following snippet will insert the GitHub octocat logo in a page:\n![](https://github.githubassets.com/images/modules/logos_page/GitHub-Mark.png){fig-align=\"left\" width=\"35px\"}\nChange all filename extensions .Rmd -&gt; .qmd (you could Preview after this change and see that the book looks the same). Note that Quarto works with .Rmd files just as well as it does .qmd, so this change is not urgent. In fact, if you have a lot of R code in your .Rmds (unlike the Faylab Lab Manual), there will be additional tinkering needed to make the code chunks happy.\n\n\nCitations\nThe Faylab Lab Manual cited two papers, presenting us with an opportunity to see how easy it is to add references to a Quarto book. Briefly, in the Visual Editor, Insert &gt; Citation &gt; DOI. Pasting the DOI or its full URL, we can insert the citation. This automatically creates a references.bib file and adds the full citations at the bottom of the chapter page (watch demo). In July 2022, we had to manually add a ## References heading, but this may not be necessary in future Quarto updates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsert citation via its DOI using RStudio Visual Editor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublishing notes\nIf the book’s output is strictly html, there’s no need to specify output-dir in _quarto.yml. The output directory default is _book/, which is what we’d like. If we wanted other types of output like like PDF or EPUB, etc. those single file outputs are also written to the output-dir (Quarto docs).\nIf you currently have a docs/ folder, delete it.\nUpdate .gitignore to ignore _book/. At the same time, we have it ignore caches and a .quarto file:\n/.quarto/\n*_cache/\n_book/\nOnce all is settled, delete _output.yml.\nOnce the Openscapes fork was fully reviewed, we made a pull request from that to the main branch of the book’s repo. Once that was merged, we set up GitHub Actions to render the book. (TODO: instructions for GitHub Actions)\n\n\nGitHub Actions\nThis book was mostly prose and screenshots without any R code. This made the conversion from RMarkdown to Quarto likely more straightforward than if you also needed to adjust code chunk options in the quarto style (#|). Our initial GitHub Action to render the converted Faylab Lab Manual failed because we had a piece of R code - even though the code was commented out! This was resolved when we deleted the line."

    "text": "Distill to quarto\nWe transitioned our events site from distill to quarto in May 2022 (github view before and after). We followed excellent notes and examples from Nick Tierney and Danielle Navarro.\nAfter we had changed all the files, the Build tab in the RStudio IDE still showed “Build website” rather then “Render Website” and “Preview Website”, and would error when we pushed them (because that button was expecting a distill site, not a quarto site). To fix this, we updated the .Rproj file. Clicking on the .Rproj file in the RStudio IDE will open a dialog box where you can click things you want (you can also open these in a text editor or from the GitHub website to see the actual text). To fix this situation with the Build tab: Project Options &gt; Build Tools &gt; Project Build Tools &gt; None.\nLooking at files /posts/_metadata.yml and _quarto.yml helps see where things are defined. For example, to make event post citations appear, we added citation: true to /posts/_metadata.yml and in _quarto.yml under the website key we set site-url: https://openscapes.github.io/events. We deleted footer.html used with distill because footer is now defined in quarto.yml.\n\nPublishing notes\n\nBackground: Our distill site had been set up to output to a docs folder, and had GitHub Settings &gt; Pages set to look there rather gh-pages branch. (Julie note: this was a new-to-me capability when we set up the events distill site in Spring 2021 so I had forgotten that was an option). We’ve inititally kept this same set-up for now with our events page in _quarto.yml: output-dir: docs. However, this is sub-optimal; better to not have to commit and push these files but to instead have a GitHub Action generate them upon a commit. So the following is what we did -\n\nDon’t specify output-dir in _quarto.yml. The output directory default is _site/, which is what we’d like.\nIf you currently have a docs/ folder (like we did as we were experimenting), delete it.\nUpdate .gitignore to ignore _site/. At the same time, we have it ignore caches and a .quarto file:\n/.quarto/\n*_cache/\n_site/\nPush these changes, merge into main.\nOn GitHub.com, in your repo, set up GitHub publishing\nFollow instructions from the explore and setup chapter."

However, “From RStudio” is only represented in one line of _quarto.yml, on line 43. This represents two strategies for including a file in your website. By default, the title of a specified file will show up in the website’s sidebar, which is what is happening with the “From RStudio” example. If you would like more control over what is written in the sidebar vs the title of your files, then the approach we took with “First Observations” is what you’ll want to do: you’ll see that only “First Observations” shows up in the sidebar as we specified in _quarto.yml, but the page’s title says “First Observations & Setup” (which in our preference was too long for the sidebar).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAs you modify _quarto.yml, the most important thing to know is that spacing matters.

    "text": "Our research focuses on developing and testing quantitative modeling tools used for assessment and management of living marine resources, working to advance sustainable decision-making for our oceans and the people who depend on them in a changing world. We focus on decision support tools applied to management of fish, marine mammal, and reptile populations, regionally in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic of the USA, as well as elsewhere nationally and internationally. A central theme is considering the performance of methods used for management given an ecosystem and socio-ecological systems perspective. We use ecosystem and population modeling to test the performance of fishery- and ecosystem-based management strategies and evaluate the robustness of management options to a range of system uncertainty, including climate change. To achieve these goals, we make use of and develop methods for stock and ecosystem assessment, and employ simulation frameworks including Management Strategy Evaluation. To support Integrated Ecosystem Assessment, we are increasingly working across disciplines to integrate dynamics of the human dimension into evaluation of management consequences of choices for human uses of the marine ecosystem.\nWe embrace principles and workflows from open data science to help make our work more shareable, accessible, and reproducible. Common to all our work is an applied approach to improve the advice for science-based decision-making by living resource management agencies; quantitative models and methods like MSE provide a transparent and explicit approach for quantifying tradeoffs among management objectives, often merely implicit in decision-making. Developing effective methods for visualizing and communicating these tradeoffs and management outcomes is an additional area of focus. We collaborate with scientists at state and federal agencies, international science organizations, and with regional fisheries management organizations. Graduate students in our lab all work closely with scientists at NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service, in Population Dynamics, Ecosystem Dynamics and Assessment, Surveys, and Protected Species.\nCurrent and recent research topics include:\n\nUsing ecosystem models to test the performance of ecosystem-based fisheries management strategies in the Northeast US\nDeveloping methods for managing New England groundfish fisheries under a changing climate\nAssessing economic effects of fishing scenarios through ecological-economic model coupling\nEvaluating performance of adaptations to scientific surveys due to spatial overlap with offshore wind installation areas\nEcosystem indicators as operational tools for fisheries management\nManagement of recreational fishery for summer flounder\nDeveloping and testing spatial stock assessment models\nIntegrating telemetry information into assessment models for highly migratory species\nDecision support tools for Integrated Ecosystem Assessment and Ecosystem-Based Management\nMultispecies stock assessment models\n\n\n\n\n\nTo operationalize ecosystem-based fisheries management, there needs to be well-tested on-ramps for including or accounting for ecosystem information in fisheries decisions, as well as understanding the performance of advice for management that includes (or doesn’t include) this information, including in the context of climate change. We have developed methods and frameworks to estimate and assess the importance of thresholds in indicators of ecosystem state given both human and environmental stressors. We tested the performance of management strategies that include fishery control rules which use the status of ecosystem indicators relative to ecosystem reference points to modify fishing mortality among species for a Georges Bank finfish community case study, and demonstrated that in some cases it is possible to improve against both economic and conservation objectives by including these indicators in decisions (see also Gaichas et al. 2017). Further work suggested that placing ceilings on system removals can also be a leading driver of multispecies fishery performance without the need for multispecies stock assessment models. Ongoing work is investigating how technical interactions and other constraints associated with the operation and management of multispecies fisheries affect the performance of these ecosystem approaches. With Dr. Lisa Kerr’s lab at Gulf of Maine Research Institute, we are also testing the performance of climate responsive management options for New England groundfish, and conducting a series of meetings with regional decision makers and stakeholders aimed at education around EBFM and benefits of management strategy evaluation for strategic decision-making in fisheries. Our work demonstrates how ecosystem indicator information could be used within current fisheries management frameworks. These results (along with others) form the basis for possible decision points in an example Fishery Ecosystem Plan under consideration for New England.\n\n\n\nEcosystem models, including whole-of-system or end-to-end models, enable tradeoffs to be quantified for a broader suite of societal and ecological objectives, allowing a more systemic look at possible outcomes for strategic management choices and uncertainties associated with forecasts. We have coupled regional economic models with the output of the ecosystem model Atlantis to calculate indicators associated with the effects of fishing strategies on jobs and earnings in the Northeast region as a whole as well as on seafood supply. We have also used these whole-of-system models to quantify plausible consequences of ocean acidification, and compare among marine ecosystems broad ecological and fishery outcomes of implementing Marine Protected Areas as part of management solutions in addition to different levels of fishing mortality and climate effects. While whole-of-system models can provide complex characterizations of coupled socio-ecological marine systems, they require data and resources, and may not be easy to fully evaluate implication of modeling choices. Qualitative and semi-quantitative models that characterize linkages within systems but do not rely on mechanistic models for dynamics of system components could be useful tools for integrating across human, physical, and ecological components of ecosystems, and for rapidly screening environmental and human use scenarios. Wildermuth et al. (2018) created a qualitative model for the Georges Bank socio-ecological system and evaluated how the ability to meet management objectives changed with alternatives for model structure. Our ongoing work as part of the ICES Working Group for the Northwest Atlantic Regional Sea (WGNARS) is evaluating what the role of these (and other) tools can be in the Integrated Ecosystem Assessment process (e.g. DePiper et al. 2017, WGNARS 2018; Wildermuth PhD thesis), developing best practices that are being incorporated in to the broader NOAA IEA program, being used by the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council as part of their Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries, and also within the larger ICES community.\nChallenges facing marine fisheries also include interactions with other marine uses, including the rapid increase of offshore wind energy. Development of offshore wind industry on the US east coast creates spatial overlap with installation areas and fisheries operations, and also requires adaptation to scientific monitoring to maintain data streams for fisheries and ecosystems used as the basis for fisheries management advice. As part of an interagency agreement between BOEM and NOAA Fisheries, we are using spatially explicit ecosystem modeling to test the effect of changes to scientific surveys as a result of spatial overlap with wind lease areas and evaluating the efficacy of supplemental monitoring strategies for data used in fisheries assessment models and management advice.\n\n\n\nScientific advice for tactical fisheries management decisions, such as quota setting, and in-season management adjustments and projections rely on statistical tools for stock assessment and species distribution modeling that can account for ecosystem information and leverage data from multiple sources, including new and developing technologies. A range of data are often collected for highly migratory species of conservation concern (and increasingly for commercial fish too), however these data, such as electronic and acoustic tagging, and photo mark-recapture, are not often directly used with population assessment models. In addition, species distribution modelling approaches that use these data do not fully account for statistical properties of these data resulting in biased inferences. Point process models and integrated population models that take a hierarchical approach to spatial and individual heterogeneity offer feasible solutions for including these data directly in assessment models and species distribution models. We have developed and applied models of this type to estimate loggerhead sea turtle distribution based on satellite tagging, spatial distribution of fish from acoustic tags (Winton et al. 2018b), toothed whale distribution in Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary, and are applying integrated methods to white sharks in Massachusetts (Winton PhD thesis, in prep.) and to multispecies interactions between forage fish and their predators. Our work to develop statistical methods for population assessment has also included evaluating the performance of model selection tools for choosing between stock assessment models that differ in how the environment affects recruitment, important for considering how fisheries productivity may be expected to change in the future. Weston (MS thesis 2018) showed that currently used methods for choosing models are not reliable for distinguishing among these effects yet the consequences of incorrect model choices can be mitigated given adaptive management frameworks with responsive harvest control rules.\nFisheries are rarely prosecuted on a species-by-species basis. However, examples of integrated population models that account for process error and observation error of multiple data types and take a multispecies approach are limited. In Trijoulet et al. (2019) and Trijoulet et al. (2020) we developed a new multispecies state-space stock assessment model and tested its performance for assessing fisheries dynamics, evaluating the treatment of diet data along with more traditional stock assessment data sources in estimation bias. We are currently also expanding the capabilities of the length-based statistical multispecies fisheries model Hydra (Gaichas et al. 2017) for application to multispecies fisheries in the Norwegian and Barents Sea, and Georges Bank, including simulation testing using output from the Atlantis ecosystem model as a virtual laboratory. This work adds to the suite of modeling tools available for assessing the status of fisheries in New England and beyond, and a common approach across projects is to evaluate and compare the performance of new methods to current approaches using simulation testing.\n\n\n\n\n\nAtlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission\nBoston Scientific Foundation\nCalifornia Ocean Science Trust\nCooperative Institute for the North Atlantic Region (CINAR)\nDepartment of Energy\nGulf of Maine Research Institute\nInternational Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES)\nMassachusetts Clean Energy Center\nMassachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries\nMid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council\nMIT Sea Grant\nNational Center for Ecological Analysis & Synthesis, UC Santa Barbara\nNational Science Foundation\nNew England Fishery Management Council\nNOAA Climate Program Office\nNOAA Fisheries & the Environment (FATE)\nNOAA Fisheries Stock Assessment Analytical Methods\nNOAA Fisheries Office of Science and Technology\nNOAA Fisheries Quantitative Ecology and Socioeconomics Training Program (QUEST)\nNOAA Northeast Fisheries Science Center\nNOAA Office of National Marine Sanctuaries\nNOAA Saltonstall Kennedy\nNOAA Sea Grant\nScience Center for Marine Fisheries, University of Southern Mississippi\nSound Resolutions LLC\nThe Nature Conservancy\nUniversity of Massachusetts Dartmouth Blue Economy\nUniversity of Massachusetts Dartmouth Marine & Undersea Science Technology Program (MUST)\nVirginia Institute of Marine Sciences\nVirginia Polytechnic Institute & State University\nWoods Hole Oceanographic Institution\nWoods Hole Sea Grant",

We tested the performance of management strategies that include fishery control rules which use the status of ecosystem indicators relative to ecosystem reference points to modify fishing mortality among species for a Georges Bank finfish community case study, and demonstrated that in some cases it is possible to improve against both economic and conservation objectives by including these indicators in decisions (see also Gaichas et al. 2017). Further work suggested that placing ceilings on system removals can also be a leading driver of multispecies fishery performance without the need for multispecies stock assessment models. Ongoing work is investigating how technical interactions and other constraints associated with the operation and management of multispecies fisheries affect the performance of these ecosystem approaches. With Dr. Lisa Kerr’s lab at Gulf of Maine Research Institute, we are also testing the performance of climate responsive management options for New England groundfish, and conducting a series of meetings with regional decision makers and stakeholders aimed at education around EBFM and benefits of management strategy evaluation for strategic decision-making in fisheries. Our work demonstrates how ecosystem indicator information could be used within current fisheries management frameworks. These results (along with others) form the basis for possible decision points in an example Fishery Ecosystem Plan under consideration for New England.\n\n\n\nEcosystem models, including whole-of-system or end-to-end models, enable tradeoffs to be quantified for a broader suite of societal and ecological objectives, allowing a more systemic look at possible outcomes for strategic management choices and uncertainties associated with forecasts. We have coupled regional economic models with the output of the ecosystem model Atlantis to calculate indicators associated with the effects of fishing strategies on jobs and earnings in the Northeast region as a whole as well as on seafood supply. We have also used these whole-of-system models to quantify plausible consequences of ocean acidification, and compare among marine ecosystems broad ecological and fishery outcomes of implementing Marine Protected Areas as part of management solutions in addition to different levels of fishing mortality and climate effects. While whole-of-system models can provide complex characterizations of coupled socio-ecological marine systems, they require data and resources, and may not be easy to fully evaluate implication of modeling choices. Qualitative and semi-quantitative models that characterize linkages within systems but do not rely on mechanistic models for dynamics of system components could be useful tools for integrating across human, physical, and ecological components of ecosystems, and for rapidly screening environmental and human use scenarios. Wildermuth et al. (2018) created a qualitative model for the Georges Bank socio-ecological system and evaluated how the ability to meet management objectives changed with alternatives for model structure. Our ongoing work as part of the ICES Working Group for the Northwest Atlantic Regional Sea (WGNARS) is evaluating what the role of these (and other) tools can be in the Integrated Ecosystem Assessment process (e.g. DePiper et al. 2017, WGNARS 2018; Wildermuth PhD thesis), developing best practices that are being incorporated in to the broader NOAA IEA program, being used by the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council as part of their Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries, and also within the larger ICES community.\nChallenges facing marine fisheries also include interactions with other marine uses, including the rapid increase of offshore wind energy. Development of offshore wind industry on the US east coast creates spatial overlap with installation areas and fisheries operations, and also requires adaptation to scientific monitoring to maintain data streams for fisheries and ecosystems used as the basis for fisheries management advice. As part of an interagency agreement between BOEM and NOAA Fisheries, we are using spatially explicit ecosystem modeling to test the effect of changes to scientific surveys as a result of spatial overlap with wind lease areas and evaluating the efficacy of supplemental monitoring strategies for data used in fisheries assessment models and management advice.\n\n\n\nScientific advice for tactical fisheries management decisions, such as quota setting, and in-season management adjustments and projections rely on statistical tools for stock assessment and species distribution modeling that can account for ecosystem information and leverage data from multiple sources, including new and developing technologies. A range of data are often collected for highly migratory species of conservation concern (and increasingly for commercial fish too), however these data, such as electronic and acoustic tagging, and photo mark-recapture, are not often directly used with population assessment models. In addition, species distribution modelling approaches that use these data do not fully account for statistical properties of these data resulting in biased inferences. Point process models and integrated population models that take a hierarchical approach to spatial and individual heterogeneity offer feasible solutions for including these data directly in assessment models and species distribution models. We have developed and applied models of this type to estimate loggerhead sea turtle distribution based on satellite tagging, spatial distribution of fish from acoustic tags (Winton et al. 2018b), toothed whale distribution in Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary, and are applying integrated methods to white sharks in Massachusetts (Winton PhD thesis, in prep.) and to multispecies interactions between forage fish and their predators. Our work to develop statistical methods for population assessment has also included evaluating the performance of model selection tools for choosing between stock assessment models that differ in how the environment affects recruitment, important for considering how fisheries productivity may be expected to change in the future. Weston (MS thesis 2018) showed that currently used methods for choosing models are not reliable for distinguishing among these effects yet the consequences of incorrect model choices can be mitigated given adaptive management frameworks with responsive harvest control rules.\nFisheries are rarely prosecuted on a species-by-species basis. However, examples of integrated population models that account for process error and observation error of multiple data types and take a multispecies approach are limited. In Trijoulet et al. (2019) and Trijoulet et al. (2020) we developed a new multispecies state-space stock assessment model and tested its performance for assessing fisheries dynamics, evaluating the treatment of diet data along with more traditional stock assessment data sources in estimation bias. We are currently also expanding the capabilities of the length-based statistical multispecies fisheries model Hydra (Gaichas et al. 2017) for application to multispecies fisheries in the Norwegian and Barents Sea, and Georges Bank, including simulation testing using output from the Atlantis ecosystem model as a virtual laboratory. This work adds to the suite of modeling tools available for assessing the status of fisheries in New England and beyond, and a common approach across projects is to evaluate and compare the performance of new methods to current approaches using simulation testing.\n\n\n\n\n\nAtlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission\nBoston Scientific Foundation\nCalifornia Ocean Science Trust\nCooperative Institute for the North Atlantic Region (CINAR)\nDepartment of Energy\nGulf of Maine Research Institute\nInternational Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES)\nMassachusetts Clean Energy Center\nMassachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries\nMid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council\nMIT Sea Grant\nNational Center for Ecological Analysis & Synthesis, UC Santa Barbara\nNational Science Foundation\nNew England Fishery Management Council\nNOAA Climate Program Office\nNOAA Fisheries & the Environment (FATE)\nNOAA Fisheries Stock Assessment Analytical Methods\nNOAA Fisheries Office of Science and Technology\nNOAA Fisheries Quantitative Ecology and Socioeconomics Training Program (QUEST)\nNOAA Northeast Fisheries Science Center\nNOAA Office of National Marine Sanctuaries\nNOAA Saltonstall Kennedy\nNOAA Sea Grant\nScience Center for Marine Fisheries, University of Southern Mississippi\nSound Resolutions LLC\nThe Nature Conservancy\nUniversity of Massachusetts Dartmouth Blue Economy\nUniversity of Massachusetts Dartmouth Marine & Undersea Science Technology Program (MUST)\nVirginia Institute of Marine Sciences\nVirginia Polytechnic Institute & State University\nWoods Hole Oceanographic Institution\nWoods Hole Sea Grant",

    "text": "Community engaged teaching and learning fellowship\nI (Gavin) joined the university’s community engaged teaching and learning faculty fellowship program in September 2024. A two year program run by the Leduc Center for Civic Engagement, the fellowship brings faculty at the university together via a series of scaffolded programming, discussion, and collaborative work sessions to help faculty interested in developing or extending service learning opportunities as part of their pedagogy and in their courses. As someone who integrates community members within my teaching and has a public-service focus to my service work at the university (primarily but not solely at supporting the regional fisheries assessment and management processI have been hoping to take part in this program for several years. For various reasons this hasn’t panned out but this year I signed up. With an idea of perhaps expanding our stock assessment practicum course into something more structured and sustainable, and to add some additional elements to my science communication course.\nThe first year of the fellowship involved monthly meetings with our cohort (new fellows in AY24 and last year’s new fellows), following amazing and thoughtful new programming developed by Leduc director Matt Roy and Nick Longo, faculty at Providence College, with short preparatory readings and videos, facilitated small- and large-group reflections on materials and understanding of motivations . We touched on a range of topics, including “Building Reciprocal Partnerships when designing Community-engaged courses”, “Assessing Impact when Reflecting on Community-Based Teaching & Learning”,  “Facilitating Better Discourse”, and “Asset-Based approach for Centering Community”. Making space and time for intentional thinking about how we do this work is so important, and I really appreciated the time that Matt and Nick put into investing in this space and facilitating these conversations with us. Crucially, this programming also connects me with colleagues in other Colleges at the university to learn from each other - often in our teaching we (faculty) are the only ones in our role in the room. I find so often that these sessions and the readings named things that we all are already doing in our classes and service work, but that the common language helped us talk through things together. I’ve also been excited to use some of the readings/videos in my class and share these with my students directly. Thanks to Nick and Matt for allowing us to share these resources this way (Forking as a worldview).  I am looking forward to implementing some of the ideas I developed ‘out loud’ with my colleagues this year in a revised model for our stock assessment practicum course in the upcoming academic year."

As a 2018 NMFS-Sea Grant Population and Ecosystem Dynamics Fellow, his PhD work looked at how assumptions about the structure and function of marine social-ecological systems can affect decision-making. He applied both quantitative and qualitative models in Bayesian statistical frameworks to analyze decision-support tools for managing the social-ecological system on Georges Bank, USA, including objectives of fisheries sustainability and human wellbeing. Robert earned a B.S. in Zoology and Biological Sciences at Colorado State University and a M.S. in Biology at Arizona State.

    "text": "Conversations with recreational fishers about fisheries science\nThis past fall, PhD student Kamran Walsh (me) teamed up with He Lab Master’s student Kevin Bennett to interview recreational fishers throughout the southern New England area. This was part of Gavin’s Science Communication class, with the specific purpose of our exercise being to better understand how anglers in our community view science and management decisions. Our interviews were more conversational than formal, with topics touching upon past and ongoing research related to New England recreational fisheries, social justice issues in the community, and fisheries outside of New England. We ultimately wanted to provide an informal, safe setting for both scientists and stakeholders to learn from each other’s experiences and discuss their views. As someone who has fished nearly his whole life and seen plenty of conflict involving the shared use of marine resources, I was especially interested in learning about how other anglers feel about the work that SMAST and other nearby research institutions are engaging in. \nOver the course of several weeks that extended through the end of the 2024 recreational saltwater fishing season in New England, Kevin and I interviewed a diverse group of anglers and industry members in a variety of settings along Massachusetts’ South Coast, Cape Cod, and coastal Rhode Island. This included purely recreational anglers, charter captains, tackle store owners, tackle company employees, and even software developers of a new smartphone app geared towards improving recreational fisheries data collection. We learned that angler and industry members’ opinions towards research and management vary, particularly involving controversial regulations such as Striped Bass recreational measures. We also were pleasantly surprised to learn that the anglers we interviewed were often highly supportive of conservation efforts and research, with multiple interviewees expressing their support for current (even more restrictive) regulations and increased fisheries enforcement. Each of the people that we talked to had unique views towards fisheries that were heavily influenced by their cultural background, worldview, and way of life. It is also worth noting that anglers expressed nearly unanimously negative views towards offshore wind for a host of reasons, stressing the importance of accounting for this friction point in the future of ocean usage allocation and marine resources management. Ultimately, it was an enriching experience that provided an ideal environment not only to learn about anglers’ honest opinions of science and management, but the region’s fisheries and fishing cultures through the unique perspectives provided.  You can view the videos here (part 1), here (part 2), here (part 3), here (part 4), and here (part 5)."

You’ll need a free GitHub account that you create at github.com (follow this advice about choosing your username).\nFirst, choose an existing website to copy. The simplest option is to start with this site: quarto-website-tutorial.\nOther options of potential interest:\n\n2021-Cloud-Hackathon\n2022-SWOT-Ocean-Cloud-Workshop\nOpenscapes Approach-Guide\n\nNext, follow these steps to fork and setup your repo with GitHub Actions from Gavin Fay, using the repo you chose. These instructions will take ~5 minutes.\nNow you’ve got a copy of your repo of choice in your own GitHub account, and you’re set to start making your own edits. Your GitHub repo is set up with a GitHub Action that will use Quarto to rebuild and republish your site anytime you make a commit: committing will trigger the GitHub Action to rebuild and republish the book.\nNote that the GitHub Action for this book does not include R or Python so those will need to be added if your website relies on code. See https://github.com/r-lib/actions for more details and examples.\n\nDownload instead of fork\nForking might not always be the way to go - you can’t fork into the same GitHub user account or organization so if for example you want to make a copy of 2021-Cloud-Hackathon repo within the same NASA-Openscapes GitHub Organization, you’ll need to download instead of fork. In this case, follow these steps to download and copy into a new repository, and set up the GitHub Action and the gh-pages branch for publishing, separately.\n\nDownload github repo files\nNavigate to https://github.com/openscapes/quarto-website-tutorial (or any other quarto site repo of choice). Click the green “Code” button and select “Download ZIP”. When it downloads on your computer, unzip the files.\n\n\nCreate a new GitHub repo\nNavigate to your GitHub account or organization, and create a new repository, naming it what you’d like. You’ll need a free GitHub account that you create at github.com (follow this advice about choosing your username). When you’re logged in, github.com will show a green button that says “New” which you’ll also see as you navigate to your username’s repository page.\n\n\nAdd original site files\nIf you’re comfortable cloning the new repository and copying files into it locally before committing and pushing back to GitHub, that is preferable to the GitHub file uploader, which does have limitations with complex repos. The uploader does not allow upload of folders, so some manual work would be required.\nTo use the GitHub file uploader, click the button next to the green “Code” button that says “Add file”. Add file &gt; Upload files. Then, on your computer, select all the files in unzipped folder (command-A or control-A), and drag them to the GitHub uploader page. Scroll down to write a commit message, which effectively saves your files when you’re working in the browser."

We’ll do this in a few steps: we’ll set up a GitHub Action within your repo, and create a gh-pages branch.\nFirst, the GitHub Action. Go back to your main view of your GitHub repository by clicking on the name of your repository at the top-left (the url in your browser window should say https://github.com/username/repo-name).\nNext to the green code button, click Add file &gt; Create new file. Name it exactly this: .github/workflows/quarto-publish.yml . In detail: start by typing the . with github and when you type the / it will give you a new text box to type workflows (plural!), then another /, and finally, quarto-publish.yml.\nNow you’ll have an empty new file. Paste the following in this empty file - you can click on the top-right of this box to copy all the code inside this code box:\non:\n  workflow_dispatch:\n  push:\n    branches: main\n\nname: Quarto Publish\n\njobs:\n  build-deploy:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    permissions:\n      contents: write\n    steps:\n      - name: Check out repository\n        uses: actions/checkout@v4\n\n      - name: Set up Quarto\n        uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/setup@v2\n        with:\n          # To install LaTeX to build PDF book \n          tinytex: true \n          # uncomment below and fill to pin a version\n          # version: 0.9.600\n      \n      # add software dependencies here\n      - name: Render and Publish\n        uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/publish@v2\n        with:\n          target: gh-pages\n        env:\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # this secret is always available for github actions\nCommit this to save your new quarto-publish.yml file. This is your GitHub Action.\nNext, we’ll create a new gh-pages branch. Go back to the main view of your GitHub repository. On the far left from the green “Code” button, click the button that says “main”. In the pull-down menu, type gh-pages - all lowercase, with a hyphen. Click the bold text that says “Create branch: gh-pages from main”.\nNow click on the Settings tab in the top right of your repository. On the left sidebar, click Pages. At the top of Pages under “Source”, select gh-pages root, and press Save (may already be saved by default).\nTo view your published website, at your main repository page, on the right side, click the gear-icon, select ‘Use your GitHub Pages website’."

    "text": "Setup\n\nRStudio and GitHub\nFor a workflow with RStudio and GitHub on your local computer, you will need four things:\n\nR\nRStudio\nGit\nGitHub\n\nFollow the UCSB MEDS Installation Guide for detailed instructions on how to create accounts, download, install, and configure on Mac and Windows. This takes about 20 minutes. (For an even more detailed walk-through, see Allison Horst’s ESM 206 Google Doc).\n\n\nClone your repo\nYou’ll start by cloning your repository into RStudio.\nFile &gt; New Project &gt; Version Control &gt; Git &gt; paste your repository name.\nR for Excel Users: Clone your repository using RStudio has detailed instructions and screenshots of these steps.\n\n\nInstall Quarto\nNext, you’ll install Quarto: https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/. After downloading, follow the installation wizard on your computer. When it is complete, you won’t see an application or any new software, but it is now available to RStudio (as well as all other applications on your computer, including the command line).\n\n\nRStudio orientation\nNow let’s take a moment to get oriented. This is an RStudio project, which is indicated in the top-right. The bottom right pane shows all the files in your project; everything we’ve cloned from GitHub. We can open any RStudio project by opening its .Rproj file, or from RStudio File &gt; Open Project ….\n\n\n\nRStudio IDE highlighting the project name and files pane\n\n\n\n\nVisual Editor\nThe RStudio Visual Editor is quite new and has features that improve your writing experience. Working in the Visual Editor feels a bit like working in a Google Doc.\nHere’s an example showing the same file in the original Source Editor with content in markdown format and in the Visual Editor with content that looks more like it will appear in a live site. You can switch freely between these modes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRStudio IDE highlighting the Source Editor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRStudio IDE highlighting the Visual Editor\n\n\n\n\n\nAlready have some content formatted in a Google Doc? You can copy-paste it into the Visual Editor and most formatting will be retained.\nThe editing bar provides familiar point and click access to text formatting options like bulleted or numbered lists.\n\n\n\nRStudio IDE highlighting the point and click editing bar\n\n\n\nKeyboard shortcuts\nThe Visual Editor also lets you use many keyboard shortcuts that might be familiar for adding boldface (command-b), italics (command-i), or headers. On a Mac, option-command-2 will make a level 2 header. Try it with option-command-1, or option-command-0 for normal text!\n\n\nInsert an image or figure\nTo insert an image (called a figure in Quarto), click the image icon. This brings up a window in which we can select the image, set its alignment, give it a caption and alt text, hyperlink it, or edit other metadata.\n\n\n\nInsert image or figure using the Visual Editor\n\n\nOnce an image is added, clicking on that image gives us editing options. We can resize it dynamically by clicking in the image and dragging a corner or side to resize. When an image is selected, its dimensions are displayed for editing. Clicking on the gray ellipsis to the right of the dimensions opens the pop-up window to access more metadata edits.\n\n\nInsert a table\nSimilar to adding an image, to insert a table, we click the Table dropdown."

This will open this markdown file in a fourth pane; the editor pane. Make a small change, for example change to today’s date on Line 4. Then, save your file; there is a disc icon at the top of the file.\nThen, render this file: press “Render” which is to the right of the disc icon that saves the file.

The course examines the history and background of fisheries management, leading to why more holistic approaches are being considered. A series of operational methods being used to implement EBFM, emphasizing technical efforts and models, are reviewed. The role of institutional structures and societal considerations in decision-making are explored to identify situations where EBFM can be successful. (Spring semester, every other year, 2024 syllabus) Next offered: Spring 2026\n\n\n\n2025 Course Website\n\nStudent-led learning in statistical analysis of ecological data. This course provides guided learning in advanced statistical analysis, as applied to ecological research and other fields of marine science. Advanced concepts in probability, hypothesis testing, and estimation will be presented by students, including analyses of example data sets and problems. Students will be required to learn selected methods independently, present topics to the class that are relevant to their graduate research and complete a class project. A computer lab, focused on introductory and intermediate programming and analysis using R, will be held for the first half of the semester. (Spring semester, odd years, 2025 syllabus) Next offered: Spring 2025\n\n\n\nPractice and development of skills for communicating scientific research to a diverse set of audiences is important for applications to fisheries management and policy. This course is for students in the sciences and focuses on the importance of defining the ‘so what’ of research and adapting messaging to specific audiences, using storytelling techniques to produce compelling presentations of scientific research. Drawing on communication case studies and their own academic interests as context, students practice delivering their message effectively for different audiences, including defining goals, identifying main points, explaining meaning and context, responding to questions, and using multimedia elements. Students develop and apply skills for communicating their research to scientific peers, the management community, stakeholders, and the general public. In-class activities and assignments emphasize presentation skills, writing, reflection, and constructive criticism through peer-review of classmates’ work. The role of the review process for how best available science is incorporated into policy and decision-making in the context of fisheries management is used as a case study during the course. Topics and activities have relevance for many disciplines at the science-management-policy interface. (Fall semester, even years, 2024 syllabus) Next offered: Fall 2026\n\n\n\nThis course provides instruction, demonstration and exercises in advanced population modeling, as applied to fishery resources. A wide range of stock assessment methods will be developed through statistical programming to fit increasingly complex models to fishery data through estimation of parameters and their variance. Programming software, including Template Model Builder, will be used for class assignments. The course is designed to train students to “have the ability to conduct high-quality scientific research in stock assessment, fishery population dynamics and related fields” (U.S. Dept.

There is an increasing need for fisheries and wildlife professionals to provide scientific advice for management in an ecosystem context. Part 1 of the course will provide students with hands on experience applying fisheries stock assessment and population models that include ecosystem effects, and consider the policy implications of including this information. Part 2 of the course will focus on broader multiple-use and human dimensions and include economic and behavioral models and models for marine spatial planning. The final section of the course will introduce whole-of-ecosystem models and demonstrate how these can be used to provide strategic advice for marine management and consider a broad suite of objectives. Although the examples used will be in a marine context, the types of models and methods discussed in the course have application in other systems.

    "text": "This coming semester (fall 2025) Dr. Fay will be offering Advanced Population Modeling (MAR 580).\nStudents not at UMassD interested in taking MAR580 Advanced Population Modeling in fall 2025, either remotely or in-person, should email Dr. Fay ASAP.\n\n\nMAR 530: Ecosystem-Based Fisheries Management\nThis course highlights the theory, challenges, and approaches for implementing ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM). The course examines the history and background of fisheries management, leading to why more holistic approaches are being considered. A series of operational methods being used to implement EBFM, emphasizing technical efforts and models, are reviewed. The role of institutional structures and societal considerations in decision-making are explored to identify situations where EBFM can be successful. (Spring semester, every other year, 2024 syllabus) Next offered: Spring 2026\n\n\n\n2025 Course Website\n\nStudent-led learning in statistical analysis of ecological data. This course provides guided learning in advanced statistical analysis, as applied to ecological research and other fields of marine science. Advanced concepts in probability, hypothesis testing, and estimation will be presented by students, including analyses of example data sets and problems. Students will be required to learn selected methods independently, present topics to the class that are relevant to their graduate research and complete a class project. A computer lab, focused on introductory and intermediate programming and analysis using R, will be held for the first half of the semester. (Spring semester, odd years, 2025 syllabus) Next offered: Spring 2025\n\n\n\nPractice and development of skills for communicating scientific research to a diverse set of audiences is important for applications to fisheries management and policy. This course is for students in the sciences and focuses on the importance of defining the ‘so what’ of research and adapting messaging to specific audiences, using storytelling techniques to produce compelling presentations of scientific research. Drawing on communication case studies and their own academic interests as context, students practice delivering their message effectively for different audiences, including defining goals, identifying main points, explaining meaning and context, responding to questions, and using multimedia elements. Students develop and apply skills for communicating their research to scientific peers, the management community, stakeholders, and the general public. In-class activities and assignments emphasize presentation skills, writing, reflection, and constructive criticism through peer-review of classmates’ work. The role of the review process for how best available science is incorporated into policy and decision-making in the context of fisheries management is used as a case study during the course. Topics and activities have relevance for many disciplines at the science-management-policy interface. (Fall semester, even years, 2024 syllabus) Next offered: Fall 2026\n\n\n\nThis course provides instruction, demonstration and exercises in advanced population modeling, as applied to fishery resources. A wide range of stock assessment methods will be developed through statistical programming to fit increasingly complex models to fishery data through estimation of parameters and their variance. Programming software, including Template Model Builder, will be used for class assignments.
